🛒 RETAIL INDUSTRY PROJECT USING SQL

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the practical application of SQL in designing and managing a retail database system. It covers database creation, data insertion, and analytical querying to simulate a simplified retail environment involving products, customers, and orders. The project aims to derive meaningful business insights through structured and well-organized data analysis.

📂 Project Structure

📄 Retail_Industry_project.sql
This SQL script is responsible for creating the database schema and defining all required tables for the retail system.

📄 Queries_on_retail_industry_project.sql
This script contains commands to insert sample data into the database and execute various business-oriented analytical queries.

🎯 Project Objectives

✔ To design and implement a normalized relational database for a retail management system
✔ To populate the database with realistic and relevant sample data
✔ To perform analytical queries in order to analyze:

Sales trends over time

Customer purchasing behavior

Most popular and high-performing products

Category-wise sales performance

🧱 Database Schema

🛍 Products Table
Stores detailed product information such as Product ID, Product Name, Category, Price, and Available Stock.

👤 Customers Table
Maintains customer-related information including Customer ID, Name, Email, Phone Number, and Address.

🧾 Orders Table
Records order transactions with attributes such as Order ID, Customer ID, Order Date, and Total Order Amount.

📦 OrderDetails Table
Stores information about individual products within each order, including Quantity and Cost.

🔗 All tables are linked using foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity and ensure consistency across the database.

▶ How to Run the Project

🔹 Step 1: Create a new database named retail_industry.
    CREATE DATABASE retail_industry;
    USE retail_industry;
🔹 Step 2: Execute the Retail_Industry_project.sql file to create the database schema.
🔹 Step 3: Run the Queries_on_retail_industry_project.sql file to insert sample data and perform analytical queries.

✨ This project provides hands-on experience in retail database design and demonstrates how SQL can be used effectively for real-world data analysis and decision-making.
